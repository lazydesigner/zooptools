    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
    <p>The EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) take effect on May 25th, 2018. I agree with the spirit of these regulations and am willing to support all laws that enable internet users to remain sovereign individuals. I aspire to embrace privacy by design and, whenever possible, to not collect and store personally identifiable information. I only collect information that helps me deliver a better service and experience for you when browsing this site, reading my content, and engaging with my products.</p>

    <p>At any time, you are free to ask me to unsubscribe you from my email newsletter or request your information to be exported and sent to you for review. Just reply to the email in question and include ‘GDPR’ in the subject line, as well as the specifics of your request. I’m here to help.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.</p>

We may use Google AdSense Advertising on our website. Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>

    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>

    <h3>According To CalOPPA We Agree To The Following:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily found on the page specified above.</li>
        <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>
        <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
        <p>Users are able to change their personal information:</p>
        <li>By emailing us</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Does Our Site Handle Do Not Track Signals?</h3>
    <p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

    <h3>Does Our Site Allow Third Party Behavioral Tracking?</h3>
    <p>It’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
    <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>
    <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

    <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

    <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>

    <p>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days. We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

    <h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>
    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

    <h3>We Collect Your Email Address In Order To:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
        <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
        <li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li>
        <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To Be In Accordance With CANSPAM We Agree To The Following:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</li>
        <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li>
        <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li>
        <li>Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
        <li>Honour opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li>
        <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li>
    </ul>
