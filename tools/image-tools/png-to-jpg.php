    <h2>Why Convert PNG to JPG? H2</h2>
    <p>PNG and JPG are different file formats and are used for unique purposes. Though PNG provides lossless quality and is transparent, JPEGs or JPG have the advantage of being smaller and applicable for professional printing and Internet sharing. The process of converting PNG to JPG clears compatibility issues, eliminates transparency issues, and makes the images printable in CMYK color.</p>
